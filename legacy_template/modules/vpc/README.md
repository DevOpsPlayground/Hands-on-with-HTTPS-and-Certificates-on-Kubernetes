# DPG - VPC module

This module creates a separate VPC to be used by the instances related to the DevOps Playground.
The goal is to give some more isolation.

You only need to provide the base CIDR block for the VPC, and the subnet CIDRs will be calculated for you.

For example:

```bash
vpc_cidr_block = 10.0.0.0/16
public_subnets = 2
private_subnets = 3
```

This will create 2 public subnets:

- 10.0.11.0/24
- 10.0.12.0/24

and 3 private subnets:

- 10.0.101.0/24
- 10.0.102.0/24
- 10.0.103.0/24

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| cidr\_block | Internal CIDR Block for the VPC | string | `"10.0.0.0/16"` | no |
| name | Name of the VPC | string | `"my-vpc"` | no |
| private\_subnets | Number of Private subnets in the VPC. By default this number is 0. If you create private subnets, you perhaps want to put autoscaling groups and/or loadbalancers into it, so mind that you'll probably need more than 1. | string | `"0"` | no |
| public\_subnets | Number of Public subnets in the VPC. By default this number is 2, and should always be higher or equal to 2, so a load balancer and other resources could be created without AWS complaining | string | `"2"` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| default\_security\_group\_id | The ID of the default security group created by AWS when creating the VPC |
| private\_subnets | List of private subnet IDs generated by the module |
| public\_subnets | List of public subnet IDs generated by the module |
| vpc\_id | outputting the VPC ID just in case it's needed |
